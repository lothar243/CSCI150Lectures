### Introduce the Raspberry Pi

* LEDs can be controlled by applied a voltage

* Momentary switch can be used
* Individual pins can be controlled programmatically
* More complicated messages can be sent over a single wire by using serial communication
  * USB pinout - http://www.engineersgallery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/usb-pinout.png
