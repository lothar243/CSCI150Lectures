# Module 8.1 - The command line

We use the command line interface (CLI) when we want a quick, powerful, text-based interface

Disadvantages (vs using a GUI)

* Initial time to learn
* Less user-friendly
* Intimidating

Advantages (vs using a GUI)

* Less resource intensive for the display
* Remote access
* It doesn't change (You don't have to relearn every 3 years)
* More versatile (You don't have to rely on someone to have implemented something for you)
* Most devices can have a command-line interface
* You look cool (?) run hollywood, or cmatrix
