Why do we use functions?

* Improving program readability
* Modular program development
* Avoid writing redundant code

Mathematical functions

* In math, functions have a specific meaning
* Use inputs, return output

Calling functions in expressions

* When a function has a return value, you can chain functions together

```python
def areaOfCircle(radius):
    return 3.141592 * r ** 2

print("The area of a circle with radius 3 is {}".format(areaOfCircle(3)))
```

Function stubs

* Incremental development

* `pass` keyword

Functions with branches/loops

Debuggers
