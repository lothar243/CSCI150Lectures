# Test Information

The test will be available during class on Thursday

You will start the test with an honesty pledge, which will be available just before class starts, so you should be a few minutes early, if possible.

If you have accommodations with ODE (like increased time), you need to schedule the test with the Learning Center - mclearningcenter@mso.umt.edu

* At least two days notice (Contact them no later than Tuesday)
* Tell me when it is scheduled - I will inform the Learning Center of the password you will need to get started

The test will consist of 7 short labs using zyBooks. You should already be very familiar with this platform from your homework.

Allowed material during the test:

* Your notes
* The zyBooks platform (including the material on it)
* Your own development environment (in case you want to run something via IDLE, or the python interpreter, for instance)

What you should know how to:

* Take user input
* Output strings, including any necessary formatting
* Work with lists, including the built-in functions we have seen in class
* Manipulate numbers (arithmetic, etc)
* Use if, elif, else statements
* Convert object types
