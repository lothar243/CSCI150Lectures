# Module 7.1 - While Loops

Input verification - how can we ensure that a user gives us acceptable input?

An if statement will execute a particular block at most once

A while loop - keep executing as long as an expression keeps evaluating to True

```bash
vim weekdayQuestion.py
vim giveNumber.py
```

Be careful not to get stuck in an infinite loop

```bash
vim infinite.py
```

This can also be used to repeat something as many times as a user would like

```bash
vim guessingGame.py
vim numStats.py
```

While loops work well when we want to repeat something but we're not sure how many times
